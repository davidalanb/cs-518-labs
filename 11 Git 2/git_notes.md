Creating a conflict:
* modify a file on Gitlab in the browser; commit
* modify the same file locally in VSCode; 
    - try to commit with VSCode Git extension
* you'll see: "There are merge conflicts, resolve them before committing"

* go to conflicting file
* accept one or the other (or both, or neither)
* go to merge editor and complete merge
* commmit

# Sprint planning

## Rubric and submission:

### Rubric

* document:  
  * \[4\] selection  
    * sprint goal (selected features)  
    * selected stories, grouped by feature  
  * \[4\] story decomposition (tasks)  
  * \[4\] data model and API specs  
  * \[4\] responsibilities  
* \[4\] **Gitlab: issue board, tasks, assignments**  
  * all team members are assigned to issues / tasks

### Submission

* Submit document that summarizes the items below.
* Add your data model and API files to your group repository and provide a link to those files in your submitted document.

## Sprint planning

### Sprint goal

* Identify sprint goal.  
    * The goal should span two features and clearly describe the result.
    * (see examples)
* Select stories that contribute to that goal.
    - this will be a subset of your priority stories.

### Story decomposition

For each chosen story:

* identify the "definition of done"
* Identify the work required to complete the story.

Examples of tasks:

Work items / Gitlab issues: 

* Design:
    * Data models
    * API specification
* Frontend:
    * UI
    * routing
    * API access
* Backend: 
    * API (internal or external)
    * Business logic
    * Database operations
* Integration
    * backend deployment
    * connect API to UI
    * frontend deployment

Notes:

* Unit testing is expected for all stories, so it doesn't need to be a separate issue.
* Backend can test independently.
* Frontend can test independently of by using mocking.

### Designs

* For each feature, design a data model and API.
* TODO:
    - data model: py files with pydantic model(s)
    - API: 
        - internal: py files with function signatures (akin to our user_api.py or user_client.py)
        - external: API endpoints (method, routes), parameters, and returns (akin to your fastAPI main.py)
        - you can produce skeleton files with just the function definitions.     

### Responsibilities

* Identify team member responsibilities using the matrix below.

|               | Feature 1 | Feature 2 |
|---            |-----------|-----------|
|**Frontend**   | Person A  | Person B  |
|**Backend**    | Person C  | Person D  |

## Gitlab

### Gitlab setup issue board

* Create iteration (done for you) 
* Setup issue board
    - plan > issue boards
    - [create list]
    - iteration > select iteration
    - move iteration in between "Open" and "Closed"

### Gitlab sprint planning

* decomposition: create issues for the work tasks you've identified.
    - use labels for:
        * feature
        * discipline (design, frontend, backend, integration)
    - (optional) use tasks for:
        * specific tasks (second-order bullets above)
* design: create designs and add to your repo.
--
* selection: Move selected stories into current iteration.
* assignments: team members should self-assign issues appropriate to them.

## Agile charter

### Introduction

Your team will brainstorm a software product that you are interested in developing.  The product will have users and authentication, which we will develop together in the labs.  We will develop an API and an application with a basic UI (basic HTML).  

In this lab, you will come up with product features, but you will be free to change those later in the semester.  Your group will develop a few features in the last few weeks of the semester.  You will present your work to the class.

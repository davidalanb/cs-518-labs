## Stories

You will create a document containing your personas and stories, and then you will enter your stories into Gitlab as issues.

### Personas and stories

Notes:
* Epics 1 and 2 stories will be the same for you as the demo project.
* Come up with stories for your Epic 3.

Personas and roles:
* Each team member contributes 1 persona.
    - personas include: name, bio, motivation, goals. 
    - each persona should be 1-2 paragraphs.
* Each persona should have about 5 stories.
    - Format: As a [user], I want to [task], so that [goal].
* The team should consolidate and organize stories by your sub-Epics 3a and 3b.

Notes:
* Hierarchy:
    - motivation: reason for wanting to achieve a goal
    - goal: what the user wants to accomplish
    - task: specific tasks needed in order to accomplish a goal

### Gitlab issues

Steps:
* Create one issue per story, and add them to the appropriate Epics.
    - The issue should have a short but meaningful title, e.g. "view course information."
    - Your full user story can be added to the issue's description.
* View your issue board.

### Collaborating

Note that members in the same subteam should be working together more closely.  (often, co-working is a good strategy - you are each working on your own tasks, but you are in close proximity so that you can communicate without delay).

### Commiting code

When you're working on a shared codebase, it's essential that you commit early and often.
Each subteam should be working on separate parts of your codebase, so conflicts should only occur between members of the same subteam (if at all).  

Each team member should be making at least **two commits per week.**

### Agile Standup Meeting

Agile standup meetings are short meetings for the whole team to share their progress, plans, and roadblocks.
Typical discussion topics include:

* What issues am I working on?  What is my progress since the last meeting?
* What will I work on now?
* Are there any impediments blocking my progress?

Each team should have at least **two standup meetings per week.** 

### Checkin with advisor

For this course, your "advisor" is your TA.

You should have **one standup meeting per week with your advisor.**
